👋👋 Hello! My name is Gustavo, and welcome to my profile!

I am a student in the field of programming, mainly focused on web development and various other projects, still figuring things out!

Currently, my favorite language is Python, and I have intermediate knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and beginner-level skills in Java.

I speak Portuguese and English, and I can get by in Spanish 😁

If you need anything, just hit me up! 👊
